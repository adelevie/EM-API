<p>Beautiful Erie,  </p>

<p>You are so good.  You make me very happy.  And I love you very much.  </p>

<p>Though we're separated by many miles this holiday, I take heart - as I always do when away from you - in the still mind-blowing fact that you care for me so.  Your love means the world to me and the least I could do was make sure that you (and third party developers) had a reliable means to triple check my love for you, unnecessary though it's even been to do so.  </p>

<p>Thank you, Erie, for who and what you are and for who and what you are to me.  My feelings for you are beyond plumbing; they touch on the sublime, the true.  </p>

<p>I love you.  </p>
